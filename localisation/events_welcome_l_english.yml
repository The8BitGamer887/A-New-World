welcome.1.t:0 "Welcome"
welcome.1.d:0 "Hello and welcome to A New World! If you didn't already know, this mod is set in an alternate 1936 where the New World has not been discovered by Europeans yet! This means the whole of the Americas has been kept in Native American hands! You may have noticed that you have no army and no unlocked researches. This is intentional. This means that you need to research European technology and create a European style army if you want to have a chance at surviving. (There are also no starting templates so you will need to use the "Fabricate Army Experience" decision to get army xp)"
welcome.1.a:0 "Lets do this!"
