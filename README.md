# A New World
 A New World is an Alternate History mod for Hearts Of Iron 4, made by a former developer at Millenium Dawn and A Very British Civil War.
 Set in an alternate 1936, where the New World had not been discovered by Europeans, meaning the land is still inhabited by Native American nations.
 Here are some features in ANW:
  - Play as one of 39 new Native American nations
  - Colonize America, or Europe
  - Pick sides in WW2, or make your own war
  - Lead your country to greatness, or solidify its destruction
  - Achieve your country's goals using our custom focus trees (coming soon)
 
# Open Source
  A New World was released on the steam workshop on 08/11/22, around a year ago now.
  A ton of things have changed in my life since then, meaning I can no longer regularly update it, and keep the project going.
  For this reason, I have made the descision to make ANW Open-Source for the time being.
  This means that you can view the source code, and submit changes you may want to make yourself.
  I will most likely close the source again once I have got a full dev team to help me code this.
  If you find yourself submitting a few pull requests, make sure to apply to be part of Perfectionist Studios, so you never lose access.
